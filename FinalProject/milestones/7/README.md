# Building Software

This software has only been tested to work on OSX (Apple Silicon/M1). To run this application, clone the repository to your preferred platform and navigate to the FinalProject folder. Use the command ```dub run``` to launch the server. In a separate terminal, run ```dub run --config=PaintApp```. The server must be running for the client to launch successfully. Open another terminal and run ``dub run --config=PaintApp``` to open a second client. To run the tests, use ```dub test```.
